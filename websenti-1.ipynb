The management, demands long working hours, treating productive employees more like laborers than valued contributors. The HR team appears ineffectual, often resorting to empty threats via email, while the Resource Management Group (RMG) directs employees to undergo various training programs.Employees often find themselves assigned to roles that may not align with their expertise, with little regard for their career aspirations. The training department bombards employees with numerous training emails, pressuring them to obtain certifications in technologies unrelated to their job roles. Promotions and salary hikes are rare, leading to widespread dissatisfaction among employees.Overall, TCS's work culture is marked by micromanagement, bias in promotions, and a lack of work-life balance, prompting many to seek opportunities elsewhere.\",\n","  'reviewRating': {'@type': 'Rating',\n","   'bestRating': '5',\n","   'worstRating': '1',\n","   'ratingValue': '2'},\n","  'publisher': {'@id': 'https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/1'},\n","  'inLanguage': 'en'},\n"," {'@type': 'Review',\n","  '@id': 'https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Review/www.tcs.com/65aeafe1fd97ef30d730b233',\n","  'itemReviewed': {'@id': 'https://www.trustpilot.com/#/schema/Organization/www.tcs.com'},\n","  'author': {'@type': 'Person',\n","   'name': 'Khushboo Israni',\n","   'url': 'https://www.trustpilot.com/users/65a7ab2a6fe6ce001234a927/'},\n","  'datePublished': '2024-01-22T20:11:45.000Z',\n","  'headline': 'A great company to work with',\n","  'reviewBody': 'A very sophisticated experience.
